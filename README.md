# 🌿 WeedWatch

**WeedWatch** is a hybrid AI + Arduino-based weed detection system designed for precision agriculture. It uses a machine learning model running on a PC to classify plant images as **weed** or **non-weed**, and then communicates the result to an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense for real-time physical feedback like LED alerts.

---

## 🚜 Project Overview

- 🧠 **Machine Learning (PC)**  
  Trained MobileNetV2 model classifies images into weed/non-weed using TensorFlow/Keras.

- 🔌 **Arduino (Microcontroller)**  
  Receives classification result via Serial and performs real-time actions — like turning on an LED for weeds.

- 🛠️ **Serial Communication (Bridge)**  
  Python sends the result to Arduino using keyboard emulation (`pyautogui`) to avoid COM port conflicts.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DhanushKarthikeyaAJ/WeedWatch.git
cd WeedWatch
```

### 2. Install Python Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Train or Load Model
- Train using your own image dataset (e.g., crops vs weeds)
- Or use the included `weed_classifier.h5` model

### 4. Upload Arduino Code
- Open `Arduino/weed_detector.ino` in Arduino IDE
- Select **Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense** from Tools > Board
- Upload the sketch
- Open **Serial Monitor** at `9600` baud

### 5. Classify and Send from PC
```bash
cd Python
python classify_and_send.py
```

This script uses `pyautogui` to send `"WEED"` or `"NON_WEED"` to the Serial Monitor (emulating keyboard input).

## 💡 Features

- ✅ Lightweight MobileNetV2-based classifier
- ✅ LED control for classification feedback
- ✅ Works even when Serial Monitor is open (keyboard input workaround)
- ✅ Simple hardware setup
- 🧪 Easily extendable to real-time webcam input or Bluetooth comms
